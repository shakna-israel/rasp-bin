Python Executables for the Raspberry Pi

---

I use the Raspberry Pi a lot, both at work and at home, as a cheap Linux environment that is easy to reflash.

The problem with re-flashing is rebuilding all the tools.

Thanks to the amazing [pex](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex) project, I can generate packages that can be imported, can run as an interpreter shell, and easily distributed.

I do not guarantee that these executables will have compiled correctly for anything other than the Raspberry Pi B+, however, if they don't include any C code, that could probably run on your system.
